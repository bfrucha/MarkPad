## MarkPad: Enabling Gestural Shortcuts for Trackpads in macOS

MarkPad is a software for macOS (working on OS X 10.11 and above) that enables gestural shortcuts on magic trackpads to trigger a large variety of commands. One can trigger these shortcuts with a single finger starting from the bezels of the trackpad. A shortcut is simply defined by a starting and ending zone on the trackpad which can be customized through the customization interface. To learn how to use the software, you can check this [tutorial](https://www.brunofruchard.com/markpad).
