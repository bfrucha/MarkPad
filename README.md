## MarkPad: Enabling Gestural Shortcuts for Trackpads in macOS

MarkPad is a software for macOS (working on OS X 10.11 and above) that enables gestural shortcuts on magic trackpads to trigger a large variety of commands. One can trigger these shortcuts with a single finger starting from the bezels of the trackpad. A shortcut is simply defined by a starting and ending zone on the trackpad which can be customized through the customization interface. To learn how to use the software, you can check this [tutorial](https://old.brunofruchard.com/markpad).

Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/rUGGTrYPuSM) presenting the primary features of MarkPad.

### Origin

MarkPad is the result of research work performed between the [DIVA](https://diva.telecom-paristech.fr/) team from [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) (formerly Télécom ParisTech) and the [Ilda](https://ilda.saclay.inria.fr/) team from the [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) institute. You can find more information about the project [here](https://brunofruchard.com/projects/markpad).

Its implementation led to a publication in the international [ACM CHI](https://chi.acm.org/) conference in 2017:
